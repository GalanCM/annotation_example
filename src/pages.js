As explained on its site, I have very little professional work that I can show publicly, so this is intended to demonstrate a range of my technical and design skills. It's still early, and there are a serious design flaws (and concerns), which I discuss below.
        From a technical perspective, it's a fairly straightforward app, written in Typescript, using a global data store (Flux pattern) to coordinate state. The most complicated code is used for drag-and-drop rearranging of tasks.`,
